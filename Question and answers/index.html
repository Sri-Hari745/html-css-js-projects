                Major credit cards are any cards that belong to one of the big four credit card networks: Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover.
                That's what stores mean by “we accept all major credit cards.” A major credit card will almost always show the logo of its network on the front. In some cases it'll be on the back.
